See how you can import an image and do basic operations like changing the format, mode, rotate,crop,etc, using the inbuilt functions from PIL. Use the help of <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html> to understand PIL library.

Now that you know how to input an image and do basic operations using PIL, we will learn some basics of signal operations. You could refer the text "Signals and Systems", by Oppenheim and Schafer for this. So, this labsheet will let you understand basic signal shifting and scaling in timedomain. Practice convolution by writing your own inbuilt function and compare with the inbuilt function convolve and convolve2d of numpy or scipy libraries. Have fun learning the properties of convolution!!!
